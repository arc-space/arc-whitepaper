# Game Design

While the full game design falls outside the scope of this document, there are a couple of things worth mentioning.

Recap the gameplay loop: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. Where the players explore the region of space they occupy to find points of interest they can expand into or simply exploit, while doing so they might have to exterminate any threads or competition they come across 

All these actions are designed to follow simple rules that could be played as a TTRPPG, simple attributes and dice rolls determine the outcome. Skill is in assessing the situation and making the correct action calls combined with a bit of lock.

#### Rolling the Dice

To secure the dice rolls Game Masters are used, as with Proof of Stake Validators, the Game Masters (GM) will provide access to the Near Network and the Extra Services needed to run the game. The GMs provide opposing rolls on actions taken and add extra entropy to prevent players from picking seeds that yield predictable results.

At the start of a round, both Players and the GMs will publish a hash of random seeds value on-chain. These values combined with the opposing hashes are used to roll the dice for every action taken. At the end of a round, the seed values are revealed on-chain together with a step-by-step list of all the actions taken. 

The result is that everyone can use the published hashes to verify the seed values and then replay the list of actions taken to verify the results. Even the contracts responsible for managing outcomes of events.

A secure, trustless, and verifiable dice rolling system with minimal on-chain events.

#### Expanding Space

Before exploration can start the layout needs to be defined, as actors mint their sections of space decisions are made and dice are rolled to define what can be found where and how things link up.

---
#### Exploring Space

Exploration can best be described as a hex crawl, it mixes standard 4x movement with some TTRPG rules. Every time a player enters a new time he selects the action to perform and then rolls the dice to determine the outcome of the move.

---
#### Exploiting Space

Gathering random resources can be time-consuming and dangerous if not done with care or protection around. The more entrepreneurial spirits among the Arcians will set up infrastructure to harvest the resources around them and encourage safe passage for trade routes.

---
#### Extermination Space

Extermination can be violent and rough. But it can also be in the form of neglect and decay. Starving regions of space from required resources might lead to infrastructure collapse and loss of value. Better not to anger your neighbors as hostile expansions and takeovers might be a real thing.
