# The Story

We are Arcians, we left the old universe behind looking for a future and our space in time. We live to explore, expand, exploit, and even exterminate when the situation calls for it. But above all, we live to link back to those we left behind.

#### The Backstory

Set in a science fiction universe eons into the future, Arc76 is one of the few Arks that remains active. An Ark itself is a megastructure built around a black hole that used to be the center of a galaxy. They are designed to act as memory storage for the collective memories of all those who inhabit its virtual realms.

Parts of the galaxy have been consumed in the construction of the ark but most of it has been shifted into energy by the black hole to power the structure and the individuals within. Everyone can feel that the end is closing in; as matter becomes scares time seems to slow down. When it finally runs out no new memories can be created, no new actions can be taken, and the Ark will freeze as time just stops.

Theorists claim that one made of pure energy, as they all are, can travel through the black hole to discover a whole new universe. Some have tried, but never has an Arcian heard back from them. Yet the practice continues, it is the only hope they have, and with every entity that takes a leap a bit more memory is freed and some energy gets created for those that stay behind.

#### A New Universe

It turns out those theorists were right, Arcians that made the journey find themselves in a place never seen before. Usually somewhere admits the stars without a welcome or another soul in sight, only stars, more stars than they ever heard of or ever saw before. 

Nothing but new places to explore and as such their journey begins. If they made it then others must be here as well! How this will play out only the future can tell.

## The Narrators

Certain parts of a story need to be crafted, managed and played out.

###### > Story Events

Disruptions and anomalies have been observed by some, but little is known about them by those who just arrived.

> In certain cases regional or network sectors might have temporary restrictions placed on them, these allow people to play out specific events or story arcs. (If you are interested in organizing an event contact the team or the administrative sector to get you set up.)

###### > Partnership Guilds

As Arcians learn more about the space around them they will find out that some people with specific markers and links in their memory banks end up roughly in the same region of space. If this is a good or bad thing for others we do not know, it does make it easier for old friends to reconnect.

> Owners of regional sectors can restrict the space they own so only that only owners of other specific tokens or collections can spawn in that region of space. (Certain exceptions do apply; for example, Tile Zero and Network Sectors minted before the restriction is in place have the choice to opt-out)
