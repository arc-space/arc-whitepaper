# Arc Economy

The economy within Arc is designed to keep the game as a game, an experience about relations between players and the tribes they create within. We minimize gamefying finance within the gameplay itself but utilize tokenomics to empower leaders, creators, and storytellers alike to build on The Story, The Brand, and The IP that is shared by them.

## The Universe

As the story indicates, the universe is unknown the first ones to enter will define what they find and create. In technical terms, the universe is randomly generated as players claim ownership and explore the space around them.

To manage the vastness of space the universe is divided into a hex grid that is divided into 6 layers: 
* 3 of these are for regional administration (Sectors).
* 1 for local cooperations to build out infrastructure (Nodes).
* 2 levels are to track finances (Energy) and encounters (Events).

The result is that the map of the universe has a tile count of 3.469.191.817. (min: 1.982.395.324) See the table below:

| Layer  |     Per Tile |     Min Tiles |     Max Tiles |          Type | { class="compact" }
|:------ | ------------:| -------------:| -------------:| -------------:|
| l1     |            7 |             4 |             7 |       Sectors |
| l2     |           19 |            76 |           133 |       Sectors |
| l3     |           37 |         2.812 |         4.921 |       Sectors |
| l4     |           61 |       171.532 |       300.181 |         Nodes |
| r5     |           91 |    15.609.412 |    27.316.471 |        Events |
| r6     |          127 | 1.982.395.324 | 3.469.191.817 |        Energy |

While space is large, in the first season the focus will be on the core and its surrounding sectors, 1, 4, or 7 hex tiles. With the option to expand in the second season.

## The Organisation

The game requires infrastructure to run; teams to produce and coordinate; creators to build and design an experience that is the game; ownership by the players and creators alike to put incentives and focus back where they belong.

Based on this premise the space Arc76 operates in is organized into 4 groups where each group has distinct roles to play.

#### l1 - Operative (GMs)

Also referred to as Game Managers (GMs), provides execution of logic modules and access to the network and protocols behind the game. 

They operated like validators nodes on a network and as such require a stake within the system, approval votes of clusters, and validation by regions to operate and be selected as game managers.

#### l2 - Regional (CMs)

Also referred to as Content/Community Managers (CMs), verify logic modules and rewards structures within.

They provide the coordination between builders, creators, and storytellers to produce logic modules that create engaging events for the players to experience.

#### l3 - Cluster (CAs)

Also referred to as Guild/Community Actors (CAs), active players and leaders within the space.

Their goals may vary and change but in general, they are the eye, ears, and megaphone. They talk to people, create educational content, and organize and promote their work or the game in general.

#### l4 - Nodes (PAs)

Also referred to as Player Actors (PAs), in-game hubs, and player services.

Active players looking to build an empire for themself or a group of friends to work with. The goal of these people is to build a place in the game world other players can call their home.
