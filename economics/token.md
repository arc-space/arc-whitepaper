# Token Economy

## Management

### Governance

Arc76 is designed as a DAO that is managed by 4 or more stakeholder DAOs. The DAO controls the entry point to the universe; implemented as a smart contract that manages ownership of all sectors in the game and manages voting rights accordingly.

* The stakeholders of the DAO are the owners of l1 sectors within the Universe. 
* The DAO owns The Story, The Universe, and all The Intellectual Property surrounding it.
* Owners of sectors are granted the rights to use and expand on the assets owned by The DAO.

### Distribution

As the contract is deployed the core tile (tile zero) at l1 is minted and assigned to the core team. For every other tile that is minted, tile zero is auto-minted and assigned to the core team as well. In the end, the team receives less than 5% of all tiles and a 20% royalty fee on all minting fees.

If all l3 tiles of the core tile are minted in the first 14 days, the team will open three more l1 tiles around the core tile and claim ownership of them as well. The remaining l3 tiles will stay locked unless all l3 tiles are sold within two weeks after minting starts.

If this milestone is reached, the last three lvl1 tiles are minted and an extra 14 days is added to the initial 14-day minting window.

          
| Layer |  Core Team |      % |      Comunity |     % |         Total |  { class="compact" }
|:------| ----------:| ------:| -------------:| -----:| -------------:|
| l1    |          7 | 100.00 |             0 |  0.00 |             7 |
| l2    |          7 |   5.26 |           126 | 94.74 |           133 |
| l3    |        133 |   2.70 |         4.788 | 97.30 |         4.921 |
| l4    |      4.921 |   1.64 |       295.260 | 98.36 |       300.181 |
| l5    |    300.181 |   1.10 |    27.016.290 | 98.90 |    27.316.471 |
| l6    | 27.316.471 |   0.79 | 3.441.875.346 | 99.21 | 3.469.191.817 |

* Note: that the core team also manages The DAO until Act 4 starts and can utilize those funds when needed.

## Incentives

### Services

Operative sectors are required to run game manager nodes. During most of season one, the core team will be managing these nodes. Eventually, as Act 4 commences and the community settles in these nodes will be sold in an auction to the community where l2 nodes vote to approve open bids.

Events at l5 are designed to be logic tokens, Sector owners can sell them to creators that wish to publish content within the game. By publishing content for the game, creators can rent or sell these tokens to regional or local hubs and receive an indefinite 2 percent royalties on token rent or sales.

### Mint Fees

With the initial sectors minted by the team, people can start claiming their part of the space by minting the tokens. By minting a token they receive permission to set the price within their section of space and sell the minting rights of its tiles. 

The table below lists the token count per layer and the target price. Example: owner of an l3 tile has paid 3.5N and can sell 36 l4 tiles for 2.1N. If the owner follows target pricing and sells two of the tiles they break even.

Every layer has an extra row of tiles added to the hex but all tiles have a target sales value of 126 NEAR.

| Layer | Tokens | Price |Tokens |
|:----- | ------:| -----:|------:|
| l2    |     18 |  7.00 | 126.0 |
| l3    |     36 |  3.50 | 126.0 |
| l4    |     60 |  2.10 | 126.0 |
| l5    |     90 |  1.40 | 126.0 |
| l6    |    126 |  1.00 | 126.0 |

* Owner of a sector has the option to manage a whitelist and limit sales to friends.
* 90% of the mint cost is paid to the owner of a sector and 10% is paid out to The DAO.
* Prices above are targets set by the core team, owners of sectors can set their prices.
* Layer 5 are Events for creators, revenue on these provide long-term returns based on gameplay.
* Layer 6 credits, not intended to be sold but available within a sector to be harvested and used.

### Royalty Fees

Royalties are fees deducted from the final sales price on internal and open markets. The royalty is paid out by the owner to the layers above them as compensation for provided assets and services as agreed on in the contracts that manage token transfers. 

The royalty fees and related payouts follow the table below.

| Layer |   Type | Royalty | Payouts | { class="compact" }
|:----- | ------:| -------:| -------:|
| l1    | Sector |       0 |       1 |
| l2    | Sector |       1 |       1 |
| l3    | Sector |       2 |       2 |
| l4    | Node   |       4 |       2 |
| l5    | Event  |       6 |       - |
| l6    | Energy |       - |       - |

* Events can be hired or bought by nodes and regions to be employed in random encounter lists.
* Events and Energy are consumable resources where ownership expires or runs out, stacking has negative effects.
* Events and Energy can be traded within the game but not on the open markets as they are dynamic and decay in value.
