# Arc76 - Whitepaper

The document aims to state the intent and reasoning behind the project and the game that is Arc76. This document is a living world built by and for the community; it will always be a work in progress. To track where we came from and where we are going; two versions exist:

###### > Current Version

A working version. A base for designers and builders to work off when implementing or expanding parts of the game.

###### > Next Draft

While not actively used for development (in most cases), the draft is where new ideas or changes are collected until a coherent and impactful update can be done. While it is not directly used to define the current rules or implementation, it is good to design and build with the next draft in mind.

## Contribute

Community feedback or new ideas are always welcome. Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/arc-space/arc-whitepaper/discussions), join [Discord](https://discord.gg/a9KYTc2Bj3) or tag us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Arc76_space)! Do note that this is Arc76 it got to the point where it is by keeping things light, simple, and focused. So don't be offended when complexity, long-running schemes or a combination of both get rejected.

```
And above all it is about the game, not about the profits. 
In the time and space we are in this has to be said.
```
