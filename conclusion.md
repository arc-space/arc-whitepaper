# Conclusion

As a team, we hope to sell out Act 1, but are set to go with less if needed. Act 2 is designed to boost the initial budgets but also to provide longer-term revenue as the community grows and expands during the first year.

#### The Plan

Use the initial budget from Act 1 and 2 to ensure them a runway of 12 months or more. If the budget is available onboard a few more members to focus on graphics and the front-end, but as with any TTRPG, text and a vivid imagination are all we need to keep moving.

At the same time, providing support to active players and early adopters through royalties on mints and sales so they get to set up shop and play along while the events that will define Season 2 unfold.

Setup and connect, bunker down for the long run as the universe will not be conquered overnight.

#### Finaly Word

Arc76 aims to be the spark that fuels a community of people looking to have some fun while sharing, providing, and supporting all those that care to partake. A community of builders, creators, and actors thriving off each other while pushing their dreams and aspirations to new highs. Individuals who are ready to face the dark forest head-on, to claim their part of time and space.

While most will choose to stay behind knowing that time will freeze. The question remains; whom will you be? Do you take that leap of faith on to the other side or do you choose to stay behind?
