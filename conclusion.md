# Conclusion

#### The Goal

With the initial sales in Act 1 and 2 the team hopes to secure funding to bring a few more members on board while ensuring them a runway of 12 months or more.

At the same time, providing support to active players and early adopters through royalties on mints and sales so they get to set up shop and play along as the events that will define Season 2 and those after unfold.

Setup and connect, bunker down for the long run as the universe will not be conquered overnight.

#### Finaly Word

Arc76 aims to be the spark that fuels a community of people looking to have some fun while sharing, providing, and supporting all those that care to partake. A community of builders, creators, and actors thriving off each other while pushing their dreams and aspirations to new highs. Individuals who are ready to face the dark forest head-on, to claim their part of time and space.

While most will choose to stay behind knowing that time will freeze. The question remains; whom will you be? Do you take that leap of faith on to the other side or do you choose to stay behind?
