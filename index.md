# Intro

As arcs flew across the universe with all the information needed to clone the civilization that created them encoded within, only two rules stood etched into every part of their being.

* Survival is the primary need of civilization.
* Civilization never ends its growth and expansion, <br />
  but the total matter in the universe remains constant.

One of these arcs can sprout a civilization numbering multiple trillions. we focus on one arc that is known as Arc76.

### The Game

With Arc76 we present to you a game that is set in a science-fiction universe, most of the game is about exploring space and defining connections with those you come across. The core gameplay loop is designed around the 4x genre; the genre is defined as: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. 

Players start in an unknown section of space, where they can explore, talk to others and look for a place to call home. Once settled in they will have to work with those around them to maintain the infrastructure, expand their reach, and protect what they have.

In the end, this is not a game for a fast dopamine shot but about a strategically planned series of events that impacts the characters and the space around them. It is about cooperating, building networks, and mastering yourself.

### The Team

A small group of dedicated enthusiasts looking to find their place within this space. While not die-hard gamers, we all love tech and played some TTRPG at one point in our lives.

But also you, the person reading this, looking to play.

#### Our Motive

###### > Disrupt The Market

The pay-to-win and monetization aspects of gaming are becoming more abusive as time passes. In the past, there used to be a strong relationship between the players and those developing the games. One knew the other, what they expected, and what would be delivered.

We want to modernize that connection again by directly serving and interacting with a global audience. With decentralized governance and trustless shared ownership, it has become possible to create systems and games that go well beyond your average Kickstarter or Marketing campaign.

This is the path we wish to explore!

#### Our Vision

###### > Build Relations

Define the gamification and codification of relations between players, creators, and builders to create a shared universe where all can find their place to work on improving themselves and those around them.

###### > Have fun

Create a fun and challenging experience where the rivalry plays out by assigning time and resources to those you support. A game where the players set the direction of the universe they explore, expand, and create.

###### > Thrive

Create a community of people thriving on the value created by those that surround them.
