# Token Drops

The primary goal of tokens is to define actors, items, nodes, and space itself. They are designed to give the player of our game access to certain parts and features of it while rewarding those that enabled the creation.

## Season 1 - Seeding Mints

The system calls for a three-stage roll-out. These 4 Acts are designed to bootstrap the story but also to give players time to explore the game, rules, and systems provided to them, all while they organise them self's in a way that gives everyone the best possible setup to become a long-term actor in the game.

<sub>*See" [Economy](/economy) for utilities and effects.*</sub>

#### Act 1 - The Exploration of space

> Minting: Sectors in Space <br />
> <sub>*Tokens: min 2.892 / max: 5.061*</sub> <br />
> <sub>*(Sale of Land Tiles)*</sub>

The division of space and initial assignment of sectors to the first Arcians to make the journey into darkness. Their job will be to explore, document, and manage the space around them.

* **Total Supply:** The maximum amount for this stage is set to 5.061 sectors, the minimum available supply will be set to 2.892 sectors.
* **Time Frame:** The time to claim sectors will be set to 14 days, if the minimum supply is surpassed before the closing of this time frame it will be extended by another 14 days.
* **In Closing:** Any sectors above the minimum supply that is not claimed before the end of the time frame defined above will be locked away as *The Unknown* until after *Stage 3*.

#### Act 2 - The expansion of time

With the stars mapped and most systems identified the next goals of Arcians is to find, exploit and manage the resources in the space around them. They will have to deice the best locations and safest travel routes before deciding where to build.

> Minting: Core Infrastructure <br />
> <sub>*Nodes: min 171.532 / max: 300.181*</sub> <br />
> <sub>*(Sale of Utility Slots)*</sub>

* **Total Supply:** The total supply is dependent on the number of sectors that get minted in *Stage 1*. The range is from 171.532 nodes once the minimal sectors are all minted up to 300.181 nodes.
* **Time Frame:** The time to claim nodes and deploy core infrastructure will be 28 days. After that only newly claimed sectors below the minimal supply of *Stage 1* will receive 14 days to claim nodes and construct infrastructure at a discounted cost.
* **In Closing:** After this claiming nodes and developing infrastructure will still be possible but it will require time and resources to be completed.

#### Act 3 - Creation of power

With the core infrastructure in place, the focus shifts to exploring and exploiting *The Unknown*. As arcians start to reach out they may find out they were not alone and that they might need to organise to defend the claims they have made.

> Minting: Actors, Guilds and Corporations <br />
> <sub>*Storage: Max supply based on Stage 2*</sub> <br />
> <sub>*(Creation of DAOs)*</sub>

* **Total Supply:** The total supply has its limits defined by the local node configurations of *Stage 2* and can be different within sectors as defined in *Stage 1*.
* **Time Frame:** The time to register extra Actors and DAOs is unlimited, but once a sector runs out only expansion or destruction of that what is will enable the creation of something new.

#### Act 4 - Disruption

As Arcians spread across time and space their actions do not go unnoticed, depending on events in previous stages this Act can be many things. This will be the last step in the repeating circle of life: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.

Extermination has come to claim its role, the form it takes or the time until it unfolds is to be determined.

- ... - Only two of the obvious routes ...
- The Others - Reaching out to the old world.
- The Invasion - A new threat from the unknown.

## Season 2 - Adventures Ahead

With initial deployment done and the initial conflict behind us, it is time to look back at the events in the past. The goal of Season 2 will be to play on old events and move the story forward. To this end, we will be looking at old and new players alike; based on their history new adventures and events will be defined, prepared and executed.
