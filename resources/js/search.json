The core gameplay loop is designed around the 4x genre; the genre is defined as: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.","Players start in an unknown section of space, where they can explore, talk to others and look for a place to call home. Once settled in they will have to work with those around them to maintain the infrastructure, expand their reach, and protect what they have.","In the end, this is not a game for a fast dopamine shot but about a strategically planned series of events that impacts the characters and the space around them. It is about cooperating, building networks, and mastering yourself."]},{"l":"The Team","p":["A small group of dedicated enthusiasts looking to find their place within this space.

An Ark itself is a megastructure built around a black hole that used to be the center of a galaxy. They are designed to act as memory storage for the collective memories of all those who inhabit its virtual realms.","Parts of the galaxy have been consumed in the construction of the ark but most of it has been shifted into energy by the black hole to power the structure and the individuals within. Everyone can feel that the end is closing in; as matter becomes scares time seems to slow down. When it finally runs out no new memories can be created, no new actions can be taken, and the Ark will freeze as time just stops.","Theorists claim that one made of pure energy, as they all are, can travel through the black hole to discover a whole new universe. Some have tried, but never has an Arcian heard back from them. Yet the practice continues, it is the only hope they have, and with every entity that takes a leap a bit more memory is freed and some energy gets created for those that stay behind."]},{"l":"A New Universe","p":["It turns out those theorists were right, Arcians that made the journey find themselves in a place never seen before. Usually somewhere admits the stars without a welcome or another soul in sight, only stars, more stars than they ever heard of or ever saw before.","Nothing but new places to explore and as such their journey begins.
