Everyone can feel that the end is closing in; as matter becomes scares time seems to slow down. When it finally runs out no new memories can be created, no new actions can be taken, and the Ark will freeze as time just stops.","Theorists claim that one made of pure energy, as they all are, can travel through the black hole to discover a whole new universe.
